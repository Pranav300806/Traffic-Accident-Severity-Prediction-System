# traffic_congestion
Urban areas face severe traffic congestion during peak hours, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. The objective of this project is to predict traffic congestion levels (Low / Medium / High) using historical traffic data such as time, day, vehicle count, and weather conditions.
