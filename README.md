# 🚗 Traffic Congestion Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts traffic congestion levels (Low / Medium / High) using machine learning based on traffic conditions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion increases travel time, fuel consumption and pollution.  
This project builds an ML model to predict congestion level using traffic parameters.

---

## 📊 Features Used
- Vehicle Count
- Average Speed
- Time of Day
- Day of Week

Target:
- Congestion Level (Low / Medium / High)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier

---

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature encoding
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Model saving

---

## 📈 Results
Best Model Accuracy: **~40%**

⚠️ Note: Dataset is synthetic and small.  
This project focuses on **ML pipeline demonstration**.
