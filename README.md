# Traffic Congestion Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts traffic congestion levels (Low, Medium, High) using
machine learning techniques based on traffic-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic dataset containing:
- Vehicle Count
- Average Speed
- Time of Day
- Day of Week
- Congestion Level (Target)

Dataset size: 100 records

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classifier

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Saving

## 📈 Results
- Best Model Accuracy: ~40%
- Performance limited due to small synthetic dataset

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/Traffic_congestion.py
